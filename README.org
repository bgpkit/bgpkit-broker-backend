At a high level, the BGPKIT Broker is a REST API service that provides search
capability for BGP MRT archive files from various data collection projects. An
user can search for matching archive files with simple REST API calls.

* Data Sources

Broker backend currently support two data collection projects: RouteViews and
RIPE RIS. Specifically, we have designed tailored data collection procedures to
efficiently crawl the data publication sites from the two projects and collect
basic information of the published BGP MRT files.

The information we currently collect for each data file includes:
- data type: either BGP updates files, or BGP table dump files.
- timestamp: the time of the beginning of the data dump, usually aligns on the
  full five-minute marks.
- url: the URL for the downloadable data file.
- collector ID: the ID of the data collector where that data comes from.

Note that the data dump frequencies for RouteViews and RIPE RIS are different.
Here is a table summarizing their frequencies:
|------------+--------------------+----------------------|
| project    | update frequency   | table dump frequency |
|------------+--------------------+----------------------|
| RouteViews | one per 15 minutes | one per 2 hours      |
| RIPE RIS   | one per 5 minutes  | one per 8 hours      |
|------------+--------------------+----------------------|

In essence, you would see more frequent BGP updates dumps from RIPE RIS and more
frequent full table dumps from RouteViews.

:END:

** broker-updater

1. user specify the collectors to gather information from
2. user specify scrape mode: ~scrape-all~, or ~scrape-latest~
    - ~scrape-all~: goes back to the beginning of time and gather everything form the collectors
    - ~scrape-latest~: only scrapes the past and current months' data, enough to update the database for latest information
3. broker spawn tasks for scraping months of data for each collector
4. broker backend handles saving scraped data

** broker-api

The Broker API provides a REST interface for querying data.
The documentation is hosted at: https://docs.broker.bgpkit.com/

** Rust API

We also provide native Rust API to access the broker data in a more ergonomic
way. Please visit our [[https://github.com/bgpkit/bgpkit-broker][Rust API repository]] to learn more.

Here is a step-by-step guide for deploying BGPKIT Broker with Docker

1. Checkout the repository
2. cd into ~deployment~ directory
3. run ~docker-compose up -d~

The initial database bootstrap phase would take about 3-5 minutes depending on your deployment environment.

After the initial bootstrap phase is done, the API service should be up and
running, currently hosted at port ~8080~. You can modify the port in
~docker-compose.yml~ file. In the mean time, a cronjob service also started,
crawling collectors for recent data every 5 minutes. The frequency can be
configured in the ~update.cron~. It is not recommended to go more frequent than
one crawl per 5 minutes.

You can check out if the API is running by running:
#+begin_src bash
curl localhost:8080/v1/meta/collectors
#+end_src
It should give you all the currently indexed data collectors.
